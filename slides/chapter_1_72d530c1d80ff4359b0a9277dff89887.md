## Introduction to GLMs

In the previous video we briefly summarized the classical general linear model, its structure and assumptions. We saw that the classical GLM is suitable for normally distributed data and things start to look strange when we introduce data that is not normally distributed, such as binary data, as we had in our example, indicating whether a person voted or not. In this video we will see how to overcome such problems in a quite elegant way by introducing generalized linear models, which will enable us to expand our palette of statical methods to a much broader context.

## Types of Response Variables

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "134953cd43"
```

`@part1`
- explanatory variables: categorical, continuous {{1}}
- responses measured are statistically independent random variables {{2}}

| Response    	| Example                                     	| Method                           	|
|-------------	|:-------------------------------------------:	|:---------------------------------:|
| Continuous  	| `sale price`                                  | Multiple regression             	|
