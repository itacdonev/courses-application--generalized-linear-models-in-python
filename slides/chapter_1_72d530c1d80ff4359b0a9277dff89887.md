In the previous video we briefly summarized the classical general linear model, its structure and assumptions. We saw that the classical GLM is suitable for normally distributed data and things start to look strange when we introduce data that is not normally distributed, such as binary data, as we had in our example, indicating whether a person voted or not. In this video we will see how to overcome such problems in a quite elegant way by introducing generalized linear models, which will enable us to expand our palette of statical methods to a much broader context.

## Constructing a GLM

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "d7f98aae07"
```

`@part1`
**Random Component** 
- Identify the type of the response variable and define the distribution function
- Observations on $y$ are independent


`@part2`
**Link Function**  
- Function of the expected value of the response variable
- Enables linearity in parameters
- $\color{blue}{g(\mu)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p$ where $\mu = E[y]$


`@part3`
**Linear (systematic) Component** 
- Determine which explanatory variables to include in the model
- $\beta_0 + \beta_1\color{blue}{x_1} + ... + \beta_p\color{blue}{x_p}$


`@part4`

## Structure of GLMs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b8b863a970"
```

`@part1`
Model formulation:   

$\large{g(\mu) = g(E[y]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p}$

&nbsp;   
   
Model formulation in Python:
```python
import statsmodels as sm
sm.GLM(formula = y ~ x, 
       data=___, 
       family = Binomial())
```

## Link functions

```yaml

```

`@part1`
|Density|Link: $\eta=g(\mu)$        |Default link    |`GLM(family=...)`|
|-------|---------------------------|--------|------|
|Normal |$\eta = \mu$               |identity|`Gaussian()`|
|Poisson|$\eta = log(\mu)$|logarithm|`Poisson()`|
|Binomial|$\eta = log[\mu/(1-\mu)]$|logit|`Binomial()`|
|Gamma|$\eta = 1/\mu$|inverse|`Gamma()`|
|Inverse Gaus|$\eta = 1/\mu^2$|inverse squared|`InverseGaussian()`|

## Model Specification

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8c9a9ee519"
```

`@part1`
We can construct GLMs out of 3 building blocks:

1. Distribution function of the resonse variable -> exponential family of distributions  
`GLM(family=...)` 

2. Link function $g(.)$   
`logit`, `logarithm`, `inverse`, ...

3. The linear component


`@script`
To sum up what we need to define in order to fit a GLM.

## Benefits of GLMs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "fb1e76bcff"
```

`@part1`
- unifies many different types of response data
- link function enables linear combinations -> many techniques from LM apply to GLMs as well
- all probability distributions belong to the exponential family of distributions
