`@script`
> Hi, my name is Ita and I welcome you to this course on Generalized Linear Models in Python. Generalized linear models or GLMs for short provide a versatile framework for statistical modeling of data and are used often to solve real world problems. We will examine several of such problems in lessons to come.

## Introduction

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "284a1d46df"
```

`@part1`
- Motivation for GLM {{1}}
- Building blocks of GLM {{2}}

Objectives: {{4}}
- understand how GLM works {{4}}
- formulate and implement a GLM in Python {{4}} 
- interpret the model results {{4}}
- make prediction {{4}}


`@script`
> We will begin by motivating the need for GLMs with the review of linear models. 
> Next, we will define the components of the GLM and learn how to implement them in Python. 
For the rest of the course we will focus on the statistical aspects of fitting the model, understanding the output and making predictions. By the end of the course you will have both a theoretical understanding and the working knowledge of how to implement a GLM in practice.

`@script`
> In this lesson we review the linear models and see how the GLMs extend this framework, i.e. to variables that are not necessarily continuous. Recall that the linear model can be written as follows,

**Simple linear model** 

$\normalsize{y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \color{red}\epsilon}$


**General linear model** (classical GLM)   

$\normalsize{y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p + \color{red}\epsilon}$


`@part2`
$y$ - response variable   
$x$ - explanatory variable  
$\beta$ - model parameters  
$\beta_0$ - intercept  
$\beta_1$ - slope  
$\epsilon$ - random error


`@script`
> And the random error term epsilon. The error measures how much of the variation in the response variable is not explained by the explanatory variable.

**Regression function**    

$\normalsize{E[y] = \mu}$

$\normalsize{ \mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p}$


`@part2`
**Assumptions** {{1}}
- linear in parameters {{2}}
- errors: independent and normally distributed $N(0,\sigma^2)$ {{3}}
- constant variance (homoscedasticity)  
$Var(y_i) = \sigma^2$ {{4}}


`@script`
The regression function tells us how much the response variable y changes on average for a unit increase in the explanatory variable x.

The assumptions are:

> the model is linear in parameters. 

> the errors are independent, normally distributed with mean zero and variance sigma squared

> constant variance, meaning the variance around the regression line is constant for all values of x

**WHAT IF ... ?**  
- our measurements of the response are not continuous, but for example binary or count {{1}}
- the variance of $y$ depends on the mean {{2}}


`@script`
> What happens when
> our response data is not continuous. 
> or the variance depends on the mean.  
To illustrate the problem let's consider an example.

## Dataset

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "55ff39cc92"
```

`@part1`
- Contamination of ground water with arsenic in Bangladesh 
- model the decision on switching wells 

|Variables|Name|Description|
|:-|-|:-|
|Response|`switch`|1 if change of water source occurred; 0 otherwise|
|Explanatory|`arsenic`| The level of arsenic contamination in the well|
|Explanatory|`distance`| Distance to the closest known safe well|
|Explanatory|`education`|Years of education of the head of the household|


`@script`
> Dataset is on the contamination of ground water with arsenic in Bangladesh where we want to model the decision on switching the current well.

> The dataset consists of a response variable switch and explanatory variables arsenic, distance and education.

## The LM model

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c497ddb85d"
```

`@part1`
```python
formula = 'switch ~ arsenic' 
``` {{1}}
```python
family = sm.families.Gaussian() 
``` {{3}}
```py
smf.glm(formula = formula, data = wells, family = family).fit()
``` {{4}}

{{2}}


`@script`
> Fit a linear model where switch is predicted by arsenic. 

> Note that our response variable is binary. The model predicts the probability that y is equal to 1.

> We define a Gaussian distribution for the response.

> and use the GLM function from the statsmodels library to fit the model. We specify the functional form of the model, distribution of the data and our dataset.

`@script`
> Taking arsenic level to be equal to 8 we immidiately see this is structurally wrong, since we get value greter than 1.

Conclusion: 
- estimated probability outside the (0,1) range
- distribution  of $y$ is highly skewed when $p$ is close to 0 or 1 - not Gaussian
- variance of $y$ depends on the mean value


`@script`
> To conclude, there is a clear violation of the estiamted probability values
> Distribution function is not gaussian, and 
> the variance of Y depends on the mean value.

## The GLM model

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "387f3c5591"
```

`@part1`
```python
formula = 'switch ~ arsenic' 
``` {{1}}
```python
family = sm.families.Binomial() 
``` {{2}}
```py
smf.glm(formula = formula, data = wells, family = family).fit()

`@script`
> Using the same data and model formula, let's change the distribution to Binomial

## The GLM model

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "33c3df5544"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
```python
formula = 'switch ~ arsenic' 

family = sm.families.Binomial() 

smf.glm(formula = formula, data = wells, family = family).fit()
```

## Summarize

- $\color{red}{\text{NOK}}$ - Ignoring the distribution of the response {{1}}
- $\color{green}{\text{OK}}$ - Specifying the Binomial distribution for the binary response {{2}}
- Introducing the function $g$ (*link function*) {{4}}

$$\normalsize{E[y]= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p}$$ {{4}}

$$\normalsize{\color{red}{g}(E[y]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_px_p}$$
{{4}}


`@script`
> Let's recap and see what changed?

> Igoring the distribution of the response and fitting a linear model lead to structurally wrong results

> To correct for this we specified the distribution for the response variable to be Binomial given the binary response.
But is this enough? Not quite. 

> We still need to transform the mean of Y so that it is linearly related to X. It can be written as follows. The details of which we will discuss in the next video.
